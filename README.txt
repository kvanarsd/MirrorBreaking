Put any jpg file in the folder. 
The jpg must be named image.jpg for it to work. 
Only one jpg can be in the folder at a time.
Click to alter the image.

Artistic intent:
This was an attempt to create a base concept for my final project idea of breaking an image like a mirror. 
So first I just wanted to figure out how to shift particles manually. This did raise some errors so I spent
sometime just making sure errors won't pop up. Then I wanted to see if I could tackle the cracking mirror effect
just with the lines. I was able to make some lines that sort of look like cracks. This is where I decided to stop
because figuring out how to shift pixels within the lines seems too difficult to achieve at the moment. So the result
right now is a more abstract image of shifting images under all the cracks. It's definetly not what I was imagining
but it does have it's own charm. Personally I think it's pretty fun to see what chaos I can make with it.
